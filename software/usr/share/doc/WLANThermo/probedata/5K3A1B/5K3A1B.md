<sup>1</sup>: The deviation between this R<sub>25</sub> and the R<sub>25</sub> shown above is not relevant, this R<sub>25</sub> is taken from the original data point which is closest to 25°C. The value taken as a factor into the calculation of the final value and serves only a scaling purpose to the Steinhart-Hart coefficients.
